Lifestreams JS SDK
=========

JavaScript Http Wrapper provides a set of methods to interact with Lifestreams API in a browser context.

Prerequisites
-------------
In order to be able to use the SDK and the API, Application ID and Application Key need to be generated in the Developer Portal.

Installation
-----------
To use the SDK in a browser, please add the following snippet to your HTML page. It should point to the latest, minified build distributed via CDN:

```html
<script src="https://assets.lifestreams.com/developer/js/api.min.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, it can also be bundled with provided build tools in two simple steps executed from the root directory:

1. Install all required NPM packages
```sh
npm install
```

2. Build the package using grunt
```sh
grunt install
```

When done and successful, the whole package will be bundled in */dist* directory and available in both minified and un-minified formats as a standalone browserify package.

Import the SDK on your web page where you want to use Timelines.

```html
<script src="js/ls-js-sdk/api.js"></script>
```

or for the minified version:

```html
<script src="js/ls-js-sdk/api.min.js"></script>
```

You can also use the built version of the SDK included in this repo if you do not wish to clone the repository and build it yourself. It should match the version we maintain on our CDN.

Configuration
-------------
Once the SDK is imported, it will expose a global LS namespace and it needs to be initialised. There are currently two ways to implement the SDK, depending on a usage scenario:

1. Secure implementation with access token.

```javascript
LS.init({
    app_token: "ACCESS_TOKEN"
});
```

To get instructions on how to generate an access token, please refer to [API Documentation link](https://developer.lifestreams.com/docs#!/Lifestreams/oauthGetToken)

2. Implementation with App ID and App Key exposed.

There are times when a securely authenticated implementation is not required, for example when in an intranet or development environment. In those cases, instead of providing a token, the SDK can be initialised by passing an *app_id* and *app_key* directly to the initialisation object:

```javascript
LS.init({
    app_id: "YOUR_3SCALE_APP_ID",
    app_key: "YOUR_3SCALE_APP_KEY"
});
```

Important thing to remember is, when in browser context, that those credentials will be exposed in the application code. It is highly recommended to not follow this approach for public facing solutions.

Additionally, initialisation method accepts the following optional parameters:

| param name | description | type
| --- | --- | --- |
| api_url | API endpoint URL, by default pointing to the latest production instance | String |
| socket_url | Socket endpoint URL, by default pointing to the latest production instance | String |


Usage
-----
## LS.api()
Make an api call to an existing endpoint and handle a response in a callback.
For available endpoints and their parameters please refer to Lifestreams Streaming API documentation.

LS.api("/timelines", "get", function(response) {
    // do something with a response
    response.forEach(function(item) {
        console.log("Timeline name: " + item.name);
    }):
});
```

Create a new timeline

```javascript
LS.api("/timelines", "post", {
    "name": "My random Timeline name"
}, function(response) {
    if (response.error) {
        // handle error
        console.log(response.error + ": " + response.message);
    } else {
        // handle successful response
        console.log(response.name + " created successfully!"
    }
});

    if(!response.error){
        console.log(response);
    }else{

    }
});
```

### Parameters

Testing
-------
### Test suite
The SDK comes with a test suite (Jasmine) with a configured Karma runner.
In order to run it in a headless PhantomJS browser, simple run the following grunt task from the root directory:

```sh
grunt test
```

Please modify the karma.conf.js file should you wish to include more runners.
